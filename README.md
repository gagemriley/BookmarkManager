## Description:
An application that allows users to add/edit/delete bookmarks from their own personal page, created as a group project for school. It includes an admin page to manage users and common bookmarks.

## Summary: 
This project was created for my Systems Development class at LCCC. It was a group project where 3 others and myself communicated with a client from Enrollment Services to develop an application. This was a huge learning experience as I got to learn about what it takes to work with a team in development using SCRUM.
